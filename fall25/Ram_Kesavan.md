### Abstract

A monolithic storage system that handles different storage media types in an efficient manner (wrt cost and performance) is a rare and complicated beast. In this talk, we’ll peek into how an enterprise-quality storage system evolved over the years to incorporate different storage media types to keep pace with technological trends. We’ll look at how some designs survived this evolution, while others needed surgical changes. I participated in this evolution as a member of the file system team at NetApp.
